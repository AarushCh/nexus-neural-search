## 📖 Overview

**FreeMe Neural Search** (codenamed *Nexus*) is a local AI-powered recommendation engine designed to break free from rigid, keyword-based search algorithms. Instead of matching exact titles, it uses **vector embeddings** and **neural networks** to understand the *meaning* behind a query.

You can ask for *"movies that feel like a rainy Tuesday in Tokyo"* or *"cyberpunk anime with philosophical themes about identity"*, and the engine will "think" about your request to find the closest semantic matches.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **Core Intelligence**
* **Semantic Vector Search:** Powered by the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` transformer model, converting text into 384-dimensional vectors.
* **Hybrid Re-Ranking:** Uses a Cross-Encoder (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) to double-check and re-score vector results for maximum accuracy.
* **LLM Integration:** Optional connection to **Trinity (Thinking)** via OpenRouter for complex reasoning queries.

### 💻 **The Nexus Interface (Frontend)**
* **Reactive Neural Network:** A custom-built HTML5 Canvas background that visualizes neural connections, reacting dynamically to cursor movement with a "synapse" effect.
* **Dynamic Theming:** Seamless toggle between **Cyber-Dark Mode** (Neon/Glassmorphism) and **Clean-Light Mode**.
* **Zero-Framework:** Built with pure Vanilla JS and CSS3 for maximum performance and zero bloat.

### ⚙️ **System Capabilities**
* **Secure Authentication:** Full JWT-based user login and registration system with Bcrypt password hashing.
* **Personalized Wishlist:** Save movies/anime to your profile. The system learns from your wishlist to adjust future recommendations.
* **Data Enrichment:** Automated scripts to fetch high-quality metadata (posters, ratings) from **TMDB** and **Jikan (MyAnimeList)** APIs.
